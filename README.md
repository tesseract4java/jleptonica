# BridJ bindings for Leptonica 1.70

This library is a wrapper around Leptonica.


## Usage

Before you can use this library, it has do be registered with BridJ:

~~~ java
BridJ.setNativeLibraryFile("leptonica",
    Paths.get("path/to/liblept.so").toFile()); // alternatively "liblept.dll"
~~~

**Note:** This is platform specific. Ensure you set the right path for the right
platform or let your users do it for you.

When the library has been set up, you can use it:

~~~ java
// create a 640x480 with 8 bits per pixel (grayscale)
Pointer<Pix> ppix = LibLept.pixCreate(640, 480, 8);

// do something with it

// destroy the pix when you don't need it any more
LibLept.pixDestroy(Pointer.pointerToPointer(ppix));
~~~

You can convert a `BufferedImage` to an instance of `Pix` and vice versa:

~~~ java
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(Paths.get("input.png").toFile());
Pointer<Pix> ppix = PixConversions.img2pix(img);
BufferedImage img2 = PixConversions.pix2img(ppix);

LibLept.pixDestroy(Pointer.pointerToPointer(ppix));
~~~
